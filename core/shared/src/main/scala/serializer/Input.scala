/**
 * Generic Input trait to be implemented by Serialization Implementations
 * 
 * See the docs for Output for the distinction between RAW, NESTED, and FIELD Input/Output.  The only difference
 * for Input is that there aren't readNestedXXX() methods.  Instead the way fields for objects are read is:
 *  - readFieldNumber(...) to get the name/number of the field
 *  - readNestedXXX() to get the value of the field (based on looking up the proper type given the name/number)
 *
